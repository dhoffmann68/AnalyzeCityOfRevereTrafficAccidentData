# AnalyzeCityOfRevereTrafficAccidentData

We partnered with the city of Revere to analyze data sets showing traffic accident reports so that we could identify causes, hotspots and potentially design a way to prevent future accidents.

Take a look at 2019-spr-darren68_gladding_ralcalde-poster.pdf and 2019-spr-darren68_gladding_ralcalde-report.pdf for more details.
